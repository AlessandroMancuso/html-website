      <p>
        Social life is another essential part of my life. Working in remote
        mode, when I finish my working day I need to go out and spend time with
        my loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        On weekends I also like to go out with friends, have a drink in company,
        go to a party or go on an outing.
